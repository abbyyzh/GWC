        <p> Hi, I'm Liz! I am fifteen years old and I live in the greater Seattle area. I am an upcoming junior at Thomas Jefferson High School. I never really tried coding before Girls Who Code so I found this as an opportunity. I wanted to create something that I relate to deeply, like body image. I have dealt with this issue all of my life and I wanted to be able to help others by informing people about body image and different things that can affect other peoples perspective on body image. I wish there where more resources that inform people like this website when i grew up. I just hope this website can help others feel more confident in their own bodies!</p>

        <h2> Dara Stotland </h2>
        <p class="title"> Web Developer</p>
        <p> Hi, I'm Dara. I'm 17 years old and I live in the Greater Seattle area. I love to rock climb and drink lots of coffee in my spare time. I was introduced to Computer Science at young age, yet I never fully delved into it until I joined Girls Who Code. I am super passionate about empowering the people around me because everyone deserves an equal opportunity to make an impact in the world. I want to use computer science to help educate others about the importance of gender equality, especially in the STEM field. I hope people can use this website to gain confidence and perspective from the world around us!</p>

        <h2> Abby Zhou </h2>
        <p class="title"> Web Developer</p>
        <p> Hi, my name is Abby! I was born in Ashland, Wisconsin but moved to Seattle, Washington when I was six years old. I am currently sixteen years old and an uprising junior at Franklin High School. In my free time, I like to paint, drink bubble tea, and go shopping. I created this website because I believe self-love and confidence is a huge issue that is not addressed enough, I want to inform young girls everywhere that they are not alone. By combining two things I am passionate about, computer science and women empowerment, I was able to succesfully complete a problem-solving tool that can benefit many others.</p>
