  Brandy Melville has been in a lot of controversy for their 'one size fits all' clothing, where all their items are either a small or extra small. This is a huge issue because it leaves shoppers feeling insecure about their bodies. Brandy Melville's clothing can only be worn by certain body sizes and therefore excludes many other shapes and sizes. This is an example of an online shop affecting body image in a negative way, causing shoppers to doubt themselves and their bodies. This is especially true when the clothing brand is popular and there is a limited size selection. Shoppers, including many young girls, will go through dangerous measures in order to fit into their one size clothing. This can lead to skipping meals, physical health issues, and a negative mentality. While this brand may not have intended to create a controversy about their sizing policy, their clothing has inevitably impacted many girls that do not fit the "one-size-fits-all".

  Fashion Nova a popular online shop with a lot of celebrities supporting them. An issue with this company is that the clothes were made for women with Hourglass body types. An Hourglass body type is where a woman has large breasts, a large butt, and skinny waist. This can be discouraging for other women and can make them feel insecure about their own bodies. The models on the Fashion Nova site have 'ideal' bodies with thigh gaps and slim waists. This ideal body type excludes many groups of people and can be disheartening, especially since Fashion Nova is what's 'in' right now. Alle Connell from the Revelist tried on popular Fashion Nova items and said,"If I tried this on as a younger woman, I would hate myself. I would think this was how clothing was meant to fit, and that my body was the problem." Alle Connell cannot be the only one who feels this way.
