  Whenever we scroll through Instagram we see these "perfect bodies". Impossibly curvy yet
  impossibly slim, it makes us wonder why don't we look like them. Why  It's hard not to feel
  this way when our society has changed the way we use social media to portray ourselves.
   Now, when we see Instagram being flooded with so called "influencers", it changes the way
    we see actual influencers. An influencer is a user with established credibility,
    large following, and endorsements. They are portrayed to be ideal, and when they're
    compared to someone on Instagram who wouldn't be defined as real, it can change the way a
    lot of people, especially young girls, feel about themselves and the world around them.
    In return, this can lead to people going to extreme measures, physically and mentally,
    just to reach the level of satisfaction they "need" from society.

The average model is thinner than 98% of american women, but is also seven inches taller.<br>What media portrays to the world is harmful and unrealistic.</p></center>

She is a well-known model in the industry for<br>those who classify as curvy models. She is not afraid of calling out<br>various modeling industries who exclude certain groups of people and has<br>been an inspiration for many young girls. Also, she is a large advocate for<br>body features, such as stretch marks, to become more normalized in our<br>society. In 2016, she starred on the cover of the famous swimwear magazine,<br>Sports Illustrated, in hope that the cover would inspire other women to love<br>their own body, no matter what shape or size. Furthermore, Ashley says that,<br>"I think there are too many women who are self-conscious about the way<br>they look, the way they see themselves in the mirror. I hope that this cover is<br>a testament to them, proving to them that they are beautiful no matter what."

She is a beauty blogger, entrepreneur, and mental<br>health advocate who shares her struggles with confidence and body image after<br>she gave birth. By telling her empowering stories through social media, she hopes<br>to build confidence in other young women. Megan uses her platforms to inform<br>and support those who have gone through the same experiences, such as eating<br>disorders and mental health issues. Megan says that, "I realise that this world of<br>ego, comparison, shallow materialistic insufficiency is suffocating me and deep<br>down I KNOW happiness cannot be bought, earned or worked toward. Happiness<br>is not 10lbs from now, it's not when you get your dream job, or when you're prettier,<br>richer or more popular. Happiness is NOW. So stop fearing what isn't real and decide<br>to live fully in the moment, fully in love with who you are on a level that's so much<br>deeper than your eyebrows, achievements or shoe collection." We LOVE that and we<br>encourage you to go followe her for more empowering quotes!
